    <h2><strong>How much should you feed your cat?</strong></h2>
    <p>The ranges of calories per pound of cat vary greatly: the guidelines range from <em>15 calories</em> per pound of body weight for inactive indoor-only sterilized cats to <em>35 calories</em> per pound for active cats. Outdoor cats may need up to <em>50 calories</em> per pound. The “average” cat needs about <em>20 calories</em> per pound.Canned foods typically range from <em>180-220 calories</em> per 5.5 ounce can; dry foods are often calorie-dense, ranging from <em>300-500 calories</em> per cup. When eating canned food, the average adult cat usually needs about one 5.5 ounce can of food per day.</p>

   <h2>How to brush your cats teeth</h2>
    
    <p>Start by gently massaging the cat's gums and teeth with your fingers. Repeat this for several short sessions for several days. Try to pick out times when your cat is calm and praise her every time and even give her treats. Your aim is to create a positive association with the procedure of having her gums and teeth touched.

When your cat accepts these sessions with ease, try to introduce the brush. Remember to use only a toothbrush designed for cats or something as gentle as gauze. Again, make sessions short and enjoyable and stop just before your cat becomes uncomfortable. At this stage, you can also introduce the paste. Make sure that it's a flavor that Kitty likes.</p>

    <h2>Tips for adopting a kitten</h2>
<ul>
    <li>If it’s been a while since you’ve been around a cat, visit with several to make sure you haven’t developed allergies in the meantime</li>
    <li>Think you want a cat but aren’t sure? <em>Consider fostering for a rescue group.</em> You’ll be able to save a cat’s life as well as test drive the idea of having your own cat</li>
    <li>Look for a kitten who has clear eyes and <em>lots of energy</em> but will also sit still to be held and cuddle</li>
    <li>Kittens <em>need a lot of play time.</em> If you don’t want all that play time focused on your bare toes or new drapes, consider adopting two or three kittens</li>
    <li>Remember - a kitten is a <em>big responsibility</em> as cats can live twenty years or more</li>
</ul>
